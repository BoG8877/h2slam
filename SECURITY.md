## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Vulnerabilities can be reported to any cybersecurity or technology firm that prevents cyber crimes from happening. 

Your server slam code referenced as h2slam and "go" is malicious... Like a virus: it reminds me of an old school ping or denial of service workload fault fallacy.  Those sorts of scripts are not supposed to be made available to the public and should be removed from anybody's attention who doesn't assuredly work in protecting IT:Security.  Slam scripts could potentially ruin good businesses and establishments; that's why they're banned from being utilized!!!  Just making that known so people don't get themselves into potentially costly lawsuits.
